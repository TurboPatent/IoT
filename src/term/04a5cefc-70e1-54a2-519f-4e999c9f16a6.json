  "text": "MAC layer",
  "definition": "<p>media access control sublayer, a layer 2 communication technology that along with the logical link control (LLC) sublayer together make up the data link layer. Within that data link layer, the LLC provides flow control and multiplexing for the logical linkwhile the MAC provides flow control and multiplexing for the transmission medium. These two sublayers together correspond to layer 2 of the OSI model. In devices implementing IEEE 802 standards, the MAC provides a control abstraction of the physical layer such that the complexities of physical link control are invisible to the LLC and upper layers of the network stack. Thus any LLC block (and higher layers) may be used with any MAC. In turn, the MAC is formally connected to the <span data-role=\"tag\" data-value=\"92b82e06-0a33-f392-2d9d-16eb3f2877a3\" id=\"id93754925-39ad-e1ea-a883-f32235dc9d93\" data-type=\"term\">PHY</span> via a media-independent interface. The MAC is typically integrated with the <span data-role=\"tag\" data-value=\"92b82e06-0a33-f392-2d9d-16eb3f2877a3\" id=\"id81350a13-1a12-96ad-c046-483912b78163\" data-type=\"term\">PHY</span> within the same device package, although in theory any MAC may be used with any <span data-role=\"tag\" data-value=\"92b82e06-0a33-f392-2d9d-16eb3f2877a3\" id=\"id18645934-3ecf-ae3b-4943-16c5c9e04c11\" data-type=\"term\">PHY</span>, independent of the transmission medium.</p>"
